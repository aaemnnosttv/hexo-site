Are you a fan of WP-CLI?  As of version 0.23, community packages (ie: 3rd-party commands) are now easily installable using the `package` command.  Perhaps you've seen a few of mine in there?

*   [**`login`**](https://aaemnnost.tv/wp-cli-commands/login/) A command for logging into to WordPress with secure passwordless links.
*   [**`dotenv`**](https://aaemnnost.tv/wp-cli-commands/dotenv/)  A command for managing an environment file from the command line.
*   [**`valet`**](https://aaemnnost.tv/wp-cli-commands/valet/)  A command for spinning up development environments in seconds using Laravel Valet.
*   **`http`**  A command for using the built-in WordPress HTTP API at the command line.
