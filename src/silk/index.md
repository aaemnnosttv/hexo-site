## What is Silk?

Silk is a library for working with WordPress in a modern, object-oriented way. Designed with the developer in mind, it gives you the tools to get things done efficiently and elegantly.

## Who is Silk For?

Silk is designed for developers who are building on top of WordPress who wish to take advantage of the benefits of an object-oriented approach, without having to rewrite the same foundational code for every project.

## Why Silk?

The core of WordPress is based on functions and maintains strong backwards-compatibility wherever possible.  That's been great for adoption of the platform, but has left developers to their own devices for those who want to develop applications using a more modern approach.

Largely inspired by Laravel (unquestionably one of the most-used and highly-regarded PHP MVC frameworks), Silk is built for modern-day PHP, using current features of the language to provide the best possible experience for developers, while integrating seamlessly with everything else that's meant to work with WordPress.

## Silk in Modern Web Development

In many ways, the future of the web (and WordPress) is JavaScript, however PHP isn't going anywhere anytime soon.  The rapid adoption of front-end frameworks like React has shown that server-side rendering of templates will soon go the way of the dodo for non-trivial applications.  By no means has server-side code become obsolete though.

In a web development landscape becoming ever-more dominated by JavaScript, Silk is still relevant for any WordPress-driven site.

## Raising the Bar: As High as it Goes

Unlike many projects in the WordPress realm, Silk has a very high standard for code quality.  The project has 100% test coverage, and is committed to maintaining that as it grows.

Silk also leverages CI integrations like [Scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/) and [Nitpick](https://nitpick-ci.com/) to make sure that it meets the highest standards available for code quality analysis, as well as adherence to the PSR-2 coding standard.

## It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This

Silk is free and open-source under the MIT License.
