For anyone who maybe hasn't heard of _[Timber](https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/)_, it's a WordPress plugin wrapper around the awesome _[Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)_ templating engine for php.

After working with WordPress for a long time, I can agree with Timber's mission statement:
> ### Because WordPress is awesome, but the_loop isn't
It's no secret that WordPress is lacking in any kind of templating out-of-the-box.  Nevermind that every other CMS and web platform/framework has this -- WordPress is perfectly content with opening and closing php tags all over the place.  OK.. ok, maybe someday.

So what's the big deal about Timber/Twig?  Twig is a templating language for PHP -- the server-side scripting language that WordPress is based on -- which makes you feel all warm an fuzzy inside when you write markup with it.

Similar to Mustache, Twig lets you write dynamic templates using simple logical structures, includes, inheritance, and all that other great shit.
