Today, _[Post Link Shortcodes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-link-shortcodes/)_ marked it's fourth release - _v0.4.0 -_ the best version yet.

The documentation for the plugin has all been completely rewritten, and is already pushing 11 pages. You can find it at it's new home on [the project's GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/post-link-shortcodes/wiki).

After writing all of that, I'm going to keep things short here.
